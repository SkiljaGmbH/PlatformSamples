# EDAWebClient

This project is a sample for a thin client that uses the Platform RestAPI to upload a stream. 
In addition, the EDA Client sample shows how to use the C# API to feed the platform. 
Currently, the sample allows to upload a single document only. 
The platform creates a work item that is linked to uploaded stream and returns information about the created work item.
