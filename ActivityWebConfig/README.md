## ActivityWebConfig

An activity can have an additional configuration window for settings that are displayed in a separate web page.

The web page (HTML5, JS) is either hosted on a web server or within platform in an iFrame.
Property parameters that are entered in the window are passed to the configuration service for storage.
Variables are also supported in custom settings.
This demo source code  also demonstrate how to translate your external dialogs based on the editor UI language given via Platform bridge.
